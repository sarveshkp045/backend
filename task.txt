The task is as follows:

As a next step in your assessment we want to conduct a technical assessment to test your fit for our team. 

Your task is: Generate your own simple Gen AI application using RAG technique:

Develop a microservice containing backend (FastAPI preferred)
Develop a microservice containing front end.
 

Backend

Use an open source text dataset for RAG (examples https://huggingface.co/datasets): choose an dataset from here
Use a pretrained LLM model (examples https://huggingface.co/models ): choose any model from here
Generate API documentation (swagger like)
Define a couple of tests that would be executed by a CI/CD pipeline (example https://github.com/features/actions)
 

Frontend

It must contain a prompt so the user could include questions (example https://streamlit.io/gallery?category=llms)
 

Deployment:

During the presentation of the use case, it will be required to present the solution already deployed at a cloud platform of your choice.
Please provide access to the repository for both microservices.
Note:

 Please take your own assumptions in case there is something that has not been defined above. 
In case you don't have access to any cloud provider, feel free to deploy locally using docker compose.
